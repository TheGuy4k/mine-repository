Description of "My Theme" from the Calculator Project

Your custom "my-mode" theme is a sleek, dark interface with a semi-transparent design and a striking blue ocean waves background. Here's a detailed breakdown of its characteristics:
Color Scheme

    Primary Background: rgba(20, 20, 20, 0.95) (very dark gray with 95% opacity)

    Secondary Background: rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.9) (slightly lighter dark gray with 90% opacity)

    Text Color: #ffffff (pure white)

    Number Buttons: rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.8) (medium-dark gray with 80% opacity)

    Operator Buttons: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9) (white with 90% opacity)

    Border: Transparent (var(--border-color): transparent)

Visual Effects

    Background Image: A beautiful blue dark sea waves image that creates a striking contrast with the semi-transparent UI elements

    Blur Effect: backdrop-filter: blur(8px) applied to calculator elements for a frosted glass effect

    Minimal Borders: Uses subtle rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) borders only where needed

Button States

    Hover States: All buttons lighten slightly when hovered (e.g., numbers go from rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.8) to rgba(70, 70, 70, 0.8))

    Operator Buttons: Maintain high contrast with pure white/light gray colors
